<h1 align="center">Lines of Action</h1>
<p>Lines of Action (LOA) is a two player, strategy board game invented by Claude Soucie.</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Each player attempts to get their pieces in one single contiguous group.</p>
<h3>Moves</h3>
<p><ul><li>Black Player moves first.</li>
  <li>Each Piece can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally.</li>
  <li>A piece can move the exact number of squares as there are pieces in the straight line
      in the moving direction (both opponents, and it's own type, AND including itself),
      from end to end in a board.</li>
  <li>A piece B "captures" an opposing piece W, if W is at the square that is exactly
      x squares away from B, in the direction d. x = all pieces (non-empty squares) in the straight line of squares
      in direction d.</li>
  <li>A piece may never land on a square that has a same type piece.</li>
  <li>A piece may jump over it's own type pieces.</li>
  <li>A piece may NOT jump over enemy pieces. In this case the piece is blocked.</li>
  <li>If a move results in both players achieving a contiguous body of pieces,
      the player that made the move is the winner.</li>
  <li>If Black Player makes a move which results in only one, remaining piece for White
      Player, and Black Player has more than 1 contiguous groups of pieces, then White Player
      has won</li>
</ul><p>

<h2>Controlling Play</h2>
<h3>Miscellaneous Menu Options</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Game</b>
    <p>Use this drop down menu to either quit the game,
      or reset the board to the starting position (with black to move).
    <font color="red"><u>NOTE:</u></font> If you wish to play the game manually after resetting, please make
    sure that atleast one player is selected as manual before selecting new, otherwise the game will
      make moves itself.</p></li>
    <li><b>Settings</b></li>
    <p>AUTO: Set a player as Machine Player.</p>
    <p> MANUAL: Set a player as a Human Player.</p>
    <li><b>Move</b></li>
    <p>UNDO: undo a single move. If you are playing against the Machine, this command undoes
      your and the opponents move.</p>
    <p>If both players are human, undoes 1 move.</p>
    <li><b>Help</b></li>
    <p>To get here.</p>
  </ul>
<b>Moving Pieces</b>
<p>A drag and drop functionality is implemented to make moves.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Pressing down on a piece will highlight the next possible moves for that piece,
  provided you press down the mouse on your piece.</li>
  <li>Keep the mouse pressed, and release it on the square you want your piece to move to.</li>
  <li>Letting go of the mouse button when the pointer is not over the legal square will
  result in the selected piece being unselected.</li>
</ol>
